/*You have to create a method "compoundArray" which should take as input two int arrays of different
length and return one int array with numbers of both arrays shuffled one by one.

Input - {1,2,3,4,5,6} and {9,8,7,6}
Output - {1,9,2,8,3,7,4,6,5,6}*/

        int[] result = new int[a.length + b.length];
        for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < result.length; j++) {
            if (j < a.length) result[i++] = a[j];
